## Overview

As the 2025 government shutdown enters its third week, this project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of its wide-reaching effects across federal operations, economic indicators, and vulnerable communities. Built with modern web technologies, the visualization presents complex government shutdown data through interactive charts, timelines, and hierarchical breakdowns.

## Features

- **Interactive Tree Visualization**: D3.js-powered hierarchical breakdown of shutdown impacts across Economic, Social, and Political sectors with expandable nodes and detailed popovers
- **Timeline Chronicle**: Track critical events from September 19 negotiations through October 15, including failed Senate votes and key political decisions
- **Hero Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics including furloughed workers (750K+), flight delays (6,000+ daily), Consumer Confidence Index trends, and GDP impact estimates
- **Enhanced Data Popovers**: Rich contextual information with embedded charts, bullet lists, and data visualizations for each impact category
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach optimized for all screen sizes
- **Patriotic Color Palette**: Thoughtful use of red, white, and blue tones with vintage patriotic aesthetic

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from official government reports, major news outlets, economic research firms (S&P Global, Goldman Sachs), and congressional records as of October 15, 2025. Sources are cited throughout the visualization.
